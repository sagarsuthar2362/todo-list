# ToDo App

This is a simple and responsive ToDo app built with React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and filter tasks based on their completion status or priority level. The tasks are saved in the local storage, so even if the page is reloaded, the tasks persist.

## Features

- Add a new task with a selected priority (Low, Medium, High).
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Clear all tasks with a single button.
- Filter tasks by completion status and priority.
- Persist tasks in local storage.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Icons (for task actions like check, delete)
- Local Storage for persistence
